# Sales-forecast
Produced a sales forecast for the next 12 months for a major electric and appliance company in the United States to plan internal resources, ensure that the right amount of materials, cash, and people is in place to satisfy, no more and no less, the projected sales and maintaining accuracy. 

Using data from September 2005 through August 2020. My task is to produce a monthly forecast for September 2020 through August 2021 (12 next months).
I came up with the best possible forecast using the linear regression, quadratic regression, exponential and quadratic with dummies. I input the forecast month by month. I looked at how COVID-19 affected the sale of this company and the aftermath of the pandemic. 

# Seasonality and trend of this industry
The electronics and appliances sector experiences notable seasonality in sales, with peak periods typically occurring in the final quarter of each year. This rise in sales can be attributed to the holiday shopping seasons, including Black Friday and Christmas, when consumers are more inclined to purchase electronics and appliances as gifts or take advantage of year-end discounts. 
Furthermore, new product launches often occur during these periods to maximize sales, thereby contributing to the seasonal trend. Historically, the industry has demonstrated growth, albeit with fluctuations that reflect broader economic conditions. For example, during economic downturns, consumers may postpone purchasing non-essential goods, such as electronics and appliances, which can result in temporary decreases in sales. Conversely, periods of economic recovery and growth often coincide with heightened consumer spending in this sector. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unparalleled challenges and changes in the industry. Initially, there was a significant impact on sales due to store closures, supply chain disruptions, and economic uncertainty. However, the pandemic also accelerated certain trends, such as increased demand for home office equipment, entertainment electronics, and kitchen appliances, as people spent more time at home. This shift not only aided the industry's recovery but also transformed consumer behavior and preferences.

# After the pandemic
The electronics and appliances industry is witnessing ongoing changes in consumer behavior and macro trends. These developments are expected to further accelerate growth in the industry. Among the key factors are the rising popularity of smart home devices, the growing adoption of energy-efficient appliances due to environmental consciousness, and the enduring demand for cutting-edge technology in entertainment and personal electronics. 
The increasing prevalence of online shopping has extended the market reach, potentially leading to sales surpassing traditional seasonal peaks. It is essential to recognize these trends and adapt our business strategies accordingly, in order to remain competitive and meet the evolving needs of our customers.
